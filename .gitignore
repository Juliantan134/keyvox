# === CRITICAL: Project-Specific Generated Files ===

# 1. Downloaded Pre-trained Models
# These are very large and should be downloaded automatically by the script, not stored in Git.
# Note: Since we are now using a local lstm_voice_model.h5, you MIGHT want to track it.

# 2. User Data and Authentication Files
# These are generated by the application and are user-specific.
